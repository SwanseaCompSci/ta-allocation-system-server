# Teaching Assistant Allocation System
{: .no_toc }

---

The Teaching Assistant Allocation System (TAAS) is a project specifically designed for the Computer Science department at Swansea University. This system automates the assignment of Teaching Assistants (TAs) to modules and labs within the department. By considering factors such as TA qualifications, availability, and module requirements, the system efficiently matches TAs with their respective modules. This optimization ensures that TAs get allocated appropriately, providing valuable support to professors and enhancing the learning experience for students.
