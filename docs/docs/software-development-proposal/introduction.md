## Motivation

In today's digital age, the Computer Science department at Swansea University is at the forefront of technological advancements and innovation. To further elevate the quality of education and enhance the learning experience for students, there is a pressing need to streamline the process of assigning Teaching Assistants (TAs) to modules and labs. The current manual allocation process is time-consuming, prone to errors, and lacks efficiency.

To address these challenges, having a dedicated Teaching Assistant Allocation System is crucial. By leveraging advanced software development techniques, this system will automate the assignment of TAs based on their qualifications, availability, and the specific requirements of each module. This optimization will ensure that TAs get allocated appropriately, matching their expertise with the corresponding modules and labs where they can make the most significant impact.

The benefits of such a system are numerous. It will enable lecturers to focus on delivering high-quality lectures and engaging with students, knowing they have the appropriate support from well-matched TAs. Students will benefit from the additional guidance and assistance provided by TAs who possess the necessary knowledge and skills for each module. Moreover, the system will free up valuable administrative time and resources, allowing for a more efficient allocation process that can adapt to changing demands and evolving needs.

By investing in the Teaching Assistant Allocation System, the Computer Science department will significantly enhance the teaching and learning ecosystem. The system will promote fairness, efficiency, and productivity, fostering an environment that nurtures academic excellence and empowers students to reach their full potential. Embracing technology-driven solutions will reinforce Swansea University's commitment to innovation, ensuring that the Computer Science department remains at the cutting edge of educational advancements and prepares students for successful careers in the ever-evolving field.
